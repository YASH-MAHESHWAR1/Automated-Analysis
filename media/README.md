#### Analysis 5: Correlation Analysis
- **Result**: The correlation between overall ratings and quality ratings was quantified to be 0.83.

*Insight*: This reinforces the findings from the scatter plot. The strong correlation confirms that higher quality ratings strongly correspond with higher overall ratings in the dataset.

#### Analysis 6: T-Test for Overall Ratings Across Languages
- **Result**: The T-statistic calculated was approximately 0.40 with a P-value of 0.686. 

*Insight*: A high P-value suggests no statistically significant difference in overall ratings among different languages, which indicates that the average ratings received across languages do not significantly vary.

#### Analysis 7: Repeatability Analysis
- **Result**: Titles were listed with their repeatability score. Titles like "Ullathai Allitha" had a repeatability score of 3, indicating consistent ratings.

*Insight*: The repeatability scores suggest some media entries are rated similarly over time, indicating consistent audience perception.

#### Analysis 8: Average Overall Ratings by Media Type
- **Result**: The analysis of average overall ratings for each type of media indicated that TV series have an average rating of 3.02, while non-fiction scored a bit higher at 3.30.

### Conclusion
The dataset provides a comprehensive insight into media ratings across various categories, showcasing trends over time, comparisons across languages, the correlation between quality and overall ratings, and the distribution of different types of media. 

Overall, the analyses reveal that while certain languages and genres outperform others in terms of quality perceptions, there is a consistent relationship between quality and overall ratings. The high repeatability of certain titles underlines foundational audience loyalty or consistent evaluations, which can be pivotal for media producers or consumers seeking quality entertainment.

### Summary of the Dataset
The `media.csv` dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding media ratings across multiple dimensions, shedding light on trends, language disparities, and audience consistency in ratings. Key findings point towards strong correlations between quality and overall ratings, with French media showcasing the highest perceived quality, while movies constitute the majority of the dataset. A general lack of statistical significance among language-based ratings indicates a need for further exploration in the dynamics of media perception.
